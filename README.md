### Custom Command Configuration

The `config.yaml` file lets you define your own commands with:
- Custom emojis
- Specific descriptions

Example configuration:
```yaml
commands:
  mark:
    emoji: "üü£"
    description: "Mark a channel as to-do"
    command_name: "mark"
  waiting:
    emoji: "‚åõ"
    description: "Mark a channel as waiting for response"
    command_name: "waiting"
  urgent:
    emoji: "üî¥"
    description: "Mark a channel as urgent"
    command_name: "urgent"
```

### Key Features

   - Easy transition between different states

     description: "Your command description"

   ```
3. Restart the bot or use `/sync`

The bot will automatically:
