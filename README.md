## Use Cases

### Support Ticket Management ðŸŽ«
Originally developed to improve support ticket management in Discord servers. The bot helps track:
- Unanswered tickets that need attention
- Tickets requiring follow-up
- Tickets pending customer response
- High-priority issues

Example workflow:
1. New ticket created: `ticket-123456`
2. Need to follow up later: `/mark` â†’ `ðŸŸ£-ticket-123456`
3. Issue resolved: `/mark` â†’ `ticket-123456`

This makes it easy to:
- Quickly identify which tickets need attention
- Keep track of pending follow-ups
- Maintain a clear overview of ticket status

### Other Use Cases

#### Project Management ðŸ“Š
- Mark channels that need updates
- Highlight channels with pending tasks
- Track channels requiring review
- Flag important announcements

#### Event Organization ðŸ“…
- Mark channels for ongoing events
- Highlight channels needing preparation
- Track post-event cleanup channels
- Flag channels for important updates

#### Community Management ðŸ‘¥
- Mark channels needing moderation
- Highlight channels with active discussions
- Track channels requiring content updates
- Flag channels for rule reviews

#### Server Organization ðŸ—‚
- Mark channels under construction
- Highlight temporary channels
- Track archived/inactive channels
- Flag channels for reorganization

## Features

- `/mark` command to toggle emoji in channel names
- `/checkmark` command to check when a channel can be marked again
- Smart rate limit handling with cooldown tracking
- Customizable emoji through environment variables or `/setemoji` command
- Role and user-based permission system
- Admin-only mode option
- `/markinfo` command to view current settings
- Works in any text channel

## Rate Limits

Due to Discord's API limitations, channel names can only be modified twice every 10 minutes. The bot handles this by:
- Tracking modification times for each channel
- Providing clear feedback on when channels can be modified again
- Offering the `/checkmark` command to check cooldown status
